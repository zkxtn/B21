(ideally written to be read while being set up in flames on a stake)

"Allow me to burn in the pire, my friends.
Allow the flames set my skin ablaze.
Allow the smoke cloud my vision
and my heartbeat race before it fades"

Let me be the sinner.
Let me feel god's wreath.
Burn me as a witch in salem.
Burn me for being out of place"

Hear the sizzle of my skin,
the shortness of my breath,
the pitch of all my screams.
watch my tears evaporate.

"Allow me to burn in the pire, my friends,"
since it was you who put me there;
you wanted to be the heros,
so you needed a villain to slay.

Watch as my body transcends,
its material form, turns to air.
Cough as the menacing dark cloud
clogs and fills up your lungs

and cry as your eyes start to fail,
cry as your throat starts to swell,
dwell on what you have made:
you've burned a friend at the stake.

"Allow me to burn in the pire, my friends.
Allow the flames set my skin ablaze."
Allow my smoke cloud your vision
and your heartbeats race before they fade.
