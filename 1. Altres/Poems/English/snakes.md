their slithering movements made me sick
i swear i still feel them on my skin
creeping down my chest & up my legs
forcing themselves, having their way w/ me

was i not sweet enough for them to eat?
to consume, to feast, to finally kill
was i prey on a hunting trip,
for sport, to capture and then free

still i feel their breath on me
i boil my skin and it still reeks
i rub, scratch away and peel
i cry, hide away and scream

their raspy tongues all over me
venomous words & disgusting spit
just a few clothes left on the murder scene
just a clothless undead victim roaming the streets

the me i was was killed that night
no investigation, no funeral, no one knows he died
the me i am is simply not alive
but a roaming ghost of who i was in the past

i swear i still felt them on my skin
i only did it to be free
to whoever founds my body, when i stop to breathe
please know, i was dead before by me i was killed
