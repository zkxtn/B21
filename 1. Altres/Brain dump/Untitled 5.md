if i don't see it then its not there
i closed my eyes to all ur mistakes
if i don't aknowledge their existence
they cant hurt me

if i they don't see me when im hurting
why do i feel as im hunting
for their attention, 
when i know i don't deserve them.

let me sit alone at night
see nothing but the dark
feel my shirt start to dump
the tears rolling from my eyes

i won't weep, won't make a sound
you won't know that im around
i'll just cry myself to sleep
wondering why i'm still here
