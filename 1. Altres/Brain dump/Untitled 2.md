i've learned the lyrics
of that song u mentioned once

i've seen the movies
that u allways talk about

now i can't think a thought
without your name popping out

i guess i got addicted
to keeping u around

so rehab, make room
i'll stay a month or two
or better i'll dig my tomb
or get the thread to close my wounds

cause i know that u
won't see me as i do
u'r the cutest dumbest person in the room

rehab make room
for this love addicted fool
